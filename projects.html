  <p>
    In an effort to better understand javascript I, decided to complete the freeCodeCamp training.  
    This is a list of the projects I created to complete the assignments.
    They all have CodePen links to the original work.  This is for easy reference.

  <ul class="project-list">
    {% for project in site.projects %}
      <li>
        <!-- <span class="project-meta">{{ project.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span> -->

        <h2>
          <a class="project-link" href="{{ project.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ project.title }}</a>
        </h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
